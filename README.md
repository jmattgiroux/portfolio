[Live Page](https://jmattgiroux.github.io/Flight-Tracker/)
This is a fork of a school project done for Web Frontend II (WDD 330).
I worked on it with my group members, [Neil Martin](https://github.com/NeilMart) and [Ryan Brower](https://github.com/rbrower28).
It was was created with Node, and uses the OpenSky Network API to display a variety of live flights on a world map.
